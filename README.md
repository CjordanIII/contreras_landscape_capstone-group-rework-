## Installation

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone [https://github.com/Practical-Seaweed/contreras_landscape_capstone.git]```
2. Navigate to the project directory ```cd contreras_landscape_capstone```

## One interesting piece of code I wrote

The carousel is one of them; I like how it can display multiple images or pieces of content like a slideshow. Even though it was difficult to code it the way I wanted, it turned out amazing for what I was trying to accomplish.
